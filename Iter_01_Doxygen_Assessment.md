### Iteration 1 - Doxygen Partial Assessment (Graded By: Saurabh Gupta)

Run on November 25, 13:28:56 PM.

<hr>

This Partial Assessment indicates a TA has begun grading your Doxygen-generated documentation. However, documentation will be graded using a Canvas rubric and grades will only be posted on Canvas once every student's documentation has been graded. We ask for your patience at this time.

#### Doxygen Tests

<hr>

**IMPORTANT NOTE:** These semi-automated tests require the existence of a Doxyfile. However, since Doxyfiles were not required as part of your Iteration 1 submission, it is OKAY if the following tests Fail. If the following tests Fail because you did not submit a Doxyfile, please look for the Doxygen regrade form which will be posted soon to handle these cases. _Please only submit a Doxygen regrade if you did not submit a Doxyfile, but still have Doxygen-compliant comments._

<hr>

+ Pass: Change into directory "project/docs".

+ Fail: Check that file "Doxyfile" exists.
