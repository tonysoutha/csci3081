Files being changed:
bus.cc, bus.h

Methods being changed:
Update, UnloadPassengers

Location of the changes:
Changes were made in the bus Update method at the point where passengers must
be unloaded. A method called UnloadPassengers was implemented to check if
passengers are at their stop and to remove them from the bus passenger list 
if so. This improves the bus Update method because it shortens the method,
making it more readable. It also avoids having the same code written twice
for outgoing and incoming routes.
