### Running the Simulator:

#### Step by step for vole users

##### Vole/Vole3D:  
###### <port_number> can be anything. Try and pick above 8000 and not multiples of 10.  
Navigate to base project directory(project/)  
make (make vis_sim, though you may have to cd into src/ for that) and start server (./build/bin/transit_sim <port_number>)  
#### You must run by doing './build/bin/vis_sim <port_number>'  
#### You cannot cd to bin/ and do './vis_sim <port_number>'  
Navigate to the following address on your VOLE browser (Firefox/Chrome):
```
http://127.0.0.1:<port_number>/web_graphics/project.html
```
  
#### Step by step for ssh users
##### SSH with Git Bash:  
###### <port_number> can be anything. Try and pick above 8000 and not multiples of 10.  
```
ssh -L <port number>:127.0.0.1:<port_number> <x500>@<cse_labs_computer>.cselabs.umn.edu
```
Navigate to base project directory(project/)  
make (make vis_sim, though you may have to cd into src/ for that) and start server (./build/bin/transit_sim <port_number>)  
#### You must run by doing './build/bin/vis_sim <port_number>'  
#### You cannot cd to bin/ and do './vis_sim <port_number>'
