Branch for refactoring iteration is in refactor/iter2.
Branch for refactoring iteration is in refactor/iter3.
These branches were not merged with devel or master..

My solution for the MACRO CONSTPASS was to comment out CONSTPASS in
passenger_factory.cc

From iteration 2:
Issues made before iteration 2 due date
  Fixed the vis_sim bus movement.

Issues made after iteration 2 due date
  Fixed an issue where config_sim did not open default file when an invalid
  file was passed in by the user.
