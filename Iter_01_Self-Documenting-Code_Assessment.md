### Iteration 1 - Self-Documenting-Code Partial Assessment (Graded By: Shrivardhan Bharadwaj)

Run on November 25, 02:15:09 AM.

<hr>

This Partial Assessment indicates a TA has begun grading your within-code documentation. However, documentation will be graded using a Canvas rubric and grades will only be posted on Canvas once every student's documentation has been graded. We ask for your patience at this time.

<hr>

+ Pass: Checkout iteration 1 final submission.




#### Necessary Files and Structure

+ Pass: Check that directory "project" exists.

+ Pass: Check that directory "project/src" exists.

+ Pass: Check that directory "project/tests" exists.

<hr>

Note that a "Pass" in the following tests does _not_ mean you have received 100% on the self-documentation portion of the tests. This "Pass" simply means the tests were able to open your files. Refer to the corresponding Canvas assignment for more details about your Self Documentating Code grade.
